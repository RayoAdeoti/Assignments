          <p>My interests are in law and software engineering. Both interests are borne out of passion to solve problems. I believe utilizing law and software engineering properly is a step towards building a better space for everyone, a step towards solving everyday problems, a step towards ending difficulties. I want to find out what the problems are and how best I can solve them through well grounded law and software engineering. It takes more than one person to solve the problems of over 7 billion people in the world, however, it is a step in the right direction.</p>
